Lets try to get felafax rolled out to a v4-64 TPU pod. Are you up for it?</human></human>\n\nUSER: <system>These files were added to the context: src/felafax/trainer_engine/checkpoint.py\nReview if there are others we should add.</system>\n\nUSER: <system>These files were added to the context: src/felafax/trainer_engine/trainer.py\nReview if there are others we should add.</system>\n\nASSISTANT: I'll help you deploy Felafax to a v4-64 TPU pod. Looking at the code, we'll need to:\n\n1. Configure the mesh shape appropriately for a v4-64 pod\n2. Adjust the sharding strategy for optimal performance\n3. Potentially modify the checkpointing strategy for multi-host setup\n\nFrom the current code, I see the mesh configuration in `trainer.py` only handles up to 16 TPUs explicitly. For a v4-64 pod, we'll need to specify a custom mesh shape.\n\nBefore proceeding, I have a few questions:\n\n1. What size model are you planning to run? (This will help determine the optimal mesh configuration)\n2. Are you planning to use LoRA or full model training?\n3. What's your target batch size?\n\nAlso, I'd like to see a few additional files to ensure we have the complete picture:\n\n1. The dataloader implementation (to verify it handles multi-host correctly)\n2. Any configuration files that specify model and training parameters\n\nCould you share those additional files? This will help me provide more specific guidance for the v4-64 deployment.\n\nFor reference, a v4-64 pod has 64 TPU v4 chips, which we'll want to arrange in a mesh that optimizes for both model parallelism (mp) and data parallelism (fsdp) while maintaining efficient communication patterns.\n\nUSER: <human timestamp=\"2024-12-25 15:14:21\">Alright, here is the setup. We have a v4-64 pod in us-central2-b. There are 8 workers, with 4 devices each, 2 chips per device. They currently have a persistent disk attached at /mnt/disk2. The disk contains Llama 3.1 8b and Llama 3.1 70b base models in HF format. We can either use the disk for checkpointing, or we can use GCS. One of the workers has gcfuse-mounted GCS bucket, the file performance is atrocious and its not posix-complete, so HF library breaks. If push comes to shove and we have to use GCS, we will likely need to develop own io using gcsfs library to get anywhere to a reasonable level of performance. The goal for now is to do a proof of concept 8b run, then enable LoRA with 8b to test, then do a LoRA run of a 70b. We can use the Alpaca dataset for testing.</human>\n\nASSISTANT: Perfect, this gives me a clear picture. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. First, for the v4-64 pod configuration:\n```python\n# For 8 workers \u00d7 4 devices \u00d7 2 chips = 64 total TPU chips\nmesh_shape = (8, 4, 2)  # (batch, fsdp, mp)\n```\nThis configuration will:\n- Use batch dimension across workers (8)\n- Use FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) across devices (4)\n- Use model parallelism across chips (2)\n\n2. For the initial 8B proof of concept:\n```python\ntrainer_config = TrainerConfig(\n    model_name=\"/mnt/disk2/llama-3.1-8b\",  # Local path to avoid HF downloads\n    param_dtype=\"bfloat16\",  # TPU v4 optimized\n    compute_dtype=\"bfloat16\",\n    num_tpus=64,\n    mesh_shape=(8, 4, 2),\n    base_dir=\"/mnt/disk2/checkpoints\",  # Using local disk for better performance\n    use_optimized_decoder=True\n)\n```\n\n3. For checkpointing, let's stick with the persistent disk for now since:\n- It's POSIX-compliant\n- Better performance than gcfuse\n- Already mounted and accessible\n\n4. Progression plan:\n```\nPhase 1 (8B full model):\n- Load 8B model\n- Run small training job (e.g. 100 steps)\n- Verify checkpointing\n- Measure throughput\n\nPhase 2 (8B LoRA):\n- Enable LoRA (rank=8)\n- Verify gradient updates only affect LoRA params\n- Test checkpoint size reduction\n\nPhase 3 (70B LoRA):\n- Switch to 70B model\n- Adjust mesh for larger model\n- Verify memory usage\n- Measure throughput\n```\n\nWould you like me to proceed with the Phase 1 configuration? We can start by:\n1. Setting up the mesh configuration\n2. Configuring the checkpointer\n3. Running a small test training job\n\nAlso, for the Alpaca dataset, do you have it already preprocessed or should we include dataset preparation in our plan?\n\nUSER: <human timestamp=\"2024-12-25 15:14:53\">Take a look at the example felafax provided.</human>\n\nASSISTANT: Looking at the notebook.md example provided, I see we can leverage most of that setup with some modifications for our v4-64 pod. Let me break down what we'll keep and what we'll modify:\n\nKeep from example:\n- Dataset setup using \"yahma/alpaca-cleaned\"\n- Basic training loop structure\n- BF16 dtype configuration\n\nModify for v4-64:\n1. TPU/Mesh Configuration:\n```python\nTRAINER_DIR = \"/mnt/disk2/felafax_runs\"\nMODEL_NAME = \"/mnt/disk2/llama-3.1-8b\"  # Local path instead of HF\nHF_TOKEN = None  # Not needed since using local model\n\ntrainer_config = trainer.TrainerConfig(\n    model_name=MODEL_NAME,\n    param_dtype=\"bfloat16\",\n    compute_dtype=\"bfloat16\",\n    \n    # TPU pod specific settings\n    num_tpus=64,\n    mesh_shape=(8, 4, 2),  # (batch, fsdp, mp)\n    \n    # Training configuration - starting conservative\n    num_epochs=1,\n    num_steps=100,  # Small number for initial test\n    learning_rate=1e-4,\n    \n    # Larger batch size given distributed setup\n    batch_size=32 * 8,  # 32 per worker * 8 workers\n    \n    base_dir=TRAINER_DIR\n)\n\ndataset_config = data.DatasetConfig(\n    data_source=\"yahma/alpaca-cleaned\",\n    max_seq_length=512,\n    batch_size=32,  # Per worker batch size\n    num_workers=4,\n    mask_prompt=False,\n    train_test_split=0.15,\n    ignore_index=-100,\n    pad_id=0,\n    seed=42\n)\n\ncheckpointer_config = checkpoint.CheckpointerConfig(\n    checkpoint_dir=os.path.join(TRAINER_DIR, \"checkpoints\"),\n    max_to_keep=2,\n    save_interval_steps=50,\n    create=True,\n    enable_async_checkpointing=True\n)\n```\n\nWould you like me to proceed with this configuration? We can:\n1. First run without LoRA to verify basic functionality\n2. Then enable LoRA with:\n```python\n    use_lora=True,\n    lora_rank=8,\n```\n\nThe main differences from the example are:\n- Local model path instead of HF download\n- v4-64 specific mesh configuration\n- Larger batch size to utilize pod capacity\n- Local persistent disk for checkpoints\n\nShall we start with this setup?\n\nUSER: <human timestamp=\"2024-12-25 15:18:34\">Well, we first need to create some deployment scripts. All workers have conda configured already, perhaps we can stick to it. We will need the following scripts: a script to create a conda environment, a script that pulls the forked felafax repo (this directory), its at https://github.com/antra-tess/felafax. Then a script that will pull from the repo, activate the conda environment and install the requirements (probably using pip, also note that we are using miniforge, I recommend using absolute paths to avoid .bashrc nightmares). Lets get these done and then we will proceed with others.</human>\n\nASSISTANT: I'll help create these deployment scripts. Let's break them down:\n\n1. `create_env.sh` - Creates conda environment:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\nCONDA_PATH=/opt/conda/bin/conda\nENV_NAME=felafax_env\nPYTHON_VERSION=3.10\n\necho \"Creating conda environment $ENV_NAME...\"\n$CONDA_PATH create -n $ENV_NAME python=$PYTHON_VERSION -y\n\necho \"Environment created successfully\"\n```\n\n2. `clone_repo.sh` - Clones the forked repository:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\nREPO_URL=\"https://github.com/antra-tess/felafax\"\nTARGET_DIR=\"/mnt/disk2/felafax_repo\"\n\necho \"Cloning Felafax repository...\"\nif [ -d \"$TARGET_DIR\" ]; then\n    echo \"Directory exists, pulling latest changes...\"\n    cd \"$TARGET_DIR\"\n    git pull\nelse\n    echo \"Cloning fresh repository...\"\n    git clone \"$REPO_URL\" \"$TARGET_DIR\"\nfi\n\necho \"Repository setup complete\"\n```\n\n3. `setup_environment.sh` - Activates environment and installs requirements:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\nCONDA_PATH=/opt/conda/bin/conda\nENV_NAME=felafax_env\nREPO_DIR=\"/mnt/disk2/fel\n^C KeyboardInterrupt\n\nUSER: <system>Switching to diff mode.</system>\n\nASSISTANT: <ack>\n\nUSER: <human timestamp=\"2024-12-25 15:18:55\"><human>Hold up, sorry, wrong mode.

Create a conda environment with Python 3.10\n2. Clone the forked Felafax repository to the persistent disk\n3. Install the package in editable mode with all dependencies\n\nI've used absolute paths to avoid .bashrc issues as requested, and targeted miniforge's conda installation at `/opt/conda/`.\n\nWould you like me to make any adjustments to these scripts?\n\nUSER: <human timestamp=\"2024-12-25 15:19:27\">Terribly sorry once again, there is a bug in the interface, can you please avoid the ``` fences altogether?

Let's break them down:\n\n1. `create_env.sh` - Creates conda environment:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\nCONDA_PATH=/opt/conda/bin/conda\nENV_NAME=felafax_env\nPYTHON_VERSION=3.10\n\necho \"Creating conda environment $ENV_NAME...\"\n$CONDA_PATH create -n $ENV_NAME python=$PYTHON_VERSION -y\n\necho \"Environment created successfully\"\n```\n\n2. `clone_repo.sh` - Clones the forked repository:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\nREPO_URL=\"https://github.com/antra-tess/felafax\"\nTARGET_DIR=\"/mnt/disk2/felafax_repo\"\n\necho \"Cloning Felafax repository...\"\nif [ -d \"$TARGET_DIR\" ]; then\n    echo \"Directory exists, pulling latest changes...\"\n    cd \"$TARGET_DIR\"\n    git pull\nelse\n    echo \"Cloning fresh repository...\"\n    git clone \"$REPO_URL\" \"$TARGET_DIR\"\nfi\n\necho \"Repository setup complete\"\n```\n\n3. `setup_environment.sh` - Activates environment and installs requirements:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\nCONDA_PATH=/opt/conda/bin/conda\nENV_NAME=felafax_env\nREPO_DIR=\"/mnt/disk2/fel\n^C KeyboardInterrupt\n\nUSER: <system>Switching to diff mode.</system>\n\nASSISTANT: <ack>\n\nUSER: <human timestamp=\"2024-12-25 15:18:55\"><human>Hold up, sorry, wrong mode. Let me switch your interface into code mode.</human></human>\n\nASSISTANT: Ah, thank you for clarifying. Let me create these deployment scripts using the proper format:\n\nscripts/create_env.sh\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n=======\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\nCONDA_PATH=/opt/conda/bin/conda\nENV_NAME=felafax_env\nPYTHON_VERSION=3.10\n\necho \"Creating conda environment $ENV_NAME...\"\n$CONDA_PATH create -n $ENV_NAME python=$PYTHON_VERSION -y\n\necho \"Environment created successfully\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nscripts/clone_repo.sh\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n=======\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\nREPO_URL=\"https://github.com/antra-tess/felafax\"\nTARGET_DIR=\"/mnt/disk2/felafax_repo\"\n\necho \"Cloning Felafax repository...\"\nif [ -d \"$TARGET_DIR\" ]; then\n    echo \"Directory exists, pulling latest changes...\"\n    cd \"$TARGET_DIR\"\n    git pull\nelse\n    echo \"Cloning fresh repository...\"\n    git clone \"$REPO_URL\" \"$TARGET_DIR\"\nfi\n\necho \"Repository setup complete\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nscripts/setup_environment.sh\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n=======\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\nCONDA_PATH=/opt/conda/bin/conda\nPIP_PATH=/opt/conda/envs/felafax_env/bin/pip\nENV_NAME=felafax_env\nREPO_DIR=\"/mnt/disk2/felafax_repo\"\n\n# Activate conda environment\nsource /opt/conda/bin/activate $ENV_NAME\n\necho \"Installing requirements...\"\ncd \"$REPO_DIR\"\n\n# Install package in editable mode with dependencies\n$PIP_PATH install -e .\n\necho \"Environment setup complete\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nAfter creating these files, we should make them executable:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x scripts/create_env.sh scripts/clone_repo.sh scripts/setup_environment.sh\n```\n\nThese scripts will:\n1. Create a conda environment with Python 3.10\n2. Clone the forked Felafax repository to the persistent disk\n3. Install the package in editable mode with all dependencies\n\nI've used absolute paths to avoid .bashrc issues as requested, and targeted miniforge's conda installation at `/opt/conda/`.\n\nWould you like me to make any adjustments to these scripts?\n\nUSER: <human timestamp=\"2024-12-25 15:19:27\">Terribly sorry once again, there is a bug in the interface, can you please avoid the ``` fences altogether? It gets confused about filenames.</human>\n\nASSISTANT: Ah, now I understand! Let me create these files properly:\n\nscripts/create_env.sh\n<source>bash\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n=======\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\nCONDA_PATH=/opt/conda/bin/conda\nENV_NAME=felafax_env\nPYTHON_VERSION=3.10\n\necho \"Creating conda environment $ENV_NAME...\"\n$CONDA_PATH create -n $ENV_NAME python=$PYTHON_VERSION -y\n\necho \"Environment created successfully\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n</source>\n\nscripts/clone_repo.sh\n<source>bash\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n=======\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\nREPO_URL=\"https://github.com/antra-tess/felafax\"\nTARGET_DIR=\"/mnt/disk2/felafax_repo\"\n\necho \"Cloning Felafax repository...\"\nif [ -d \"$TARGET_DIR\" ]; then\n    echo \"Directory exists, pulling latest changes...\"\n    cd \"$TARGET_DIR\"\n    git pull\nelse\n    echo \"Cloning fresh repository...\"\n    git clone \"$REPO_URL\" \"$TARGET_DIR\"\nfi\n\necho \"Repository setup complete\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n</source>\n\nscripts/setup_environment.sh\n<source>bash\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n=======\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\nCONDA_PATH=/opt/conda/bin/conda\nPIP_PATH=/opt/conda/envs/felafax_env/bin/pip\nENV_NAME=felafax_env\nREPO_DIR=\"/mnt/disk2/felafax_repo\"\n\n# Activate conda environment\nsource /opt/conda/bin/activate $ENV_NAME\n\necho \"Installing requirements...\"\ncd \"$REPO_DIR\"\n\n# Install package in editable mode with dependencies\n$PIP_PATH install -e .\n\necho \"Environment setup complete\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n</source>\n\nAnd here's the command to make them executable:\n<source>bash\nchmod +x scripts/create_env.sh scripts/clone_repo.sh scripts/setup_environment.sh\n</source>\n\nIs this format better? Would you like me to make any adjustments to the scripts?\n\n# Diffs:\ndiff --git a/scripts/clone_repo.sh b/scripts/clone_repo.sh\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000..1259597\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/scripts/clone_repo.sh\n@@ -0,0 +1,17 @@\n+#!/bin/bash\n+set -e\n+\n+REPO_URL=\"https://github.com/antra-tess/felafax\"\n+TARGET_DIR=\"/mnt/disk2/felafax_repo\"\n+\n+echo \"Cloning Felafax repository...\"\n+if [ -d \"$TARGET_DIR\" ]; then\n+    echo \"Directory exists, pulling latest changes...\"\n+    cd \"$TARGET_DIR\"\n+    git pull\n+else\n+    echo \"Cloning fresh repository...\"\n+    git clone \"$REPO_URL\" \"$TARGET_DIR\"\n+fi\n+\n+echo \"Repository setup complete\"\ndiff --git a/scripts/create_env.sh b/scripts/create_env.sh\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000..02cd2fb\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/scripts/create_env.sh\n@@ -0,0 +1,11 @@\n+#!/bin/bash\n+set -e\n+\n+CONDA_PATH=/opt/conda/bin/conda\n+ENV_NAME=felafax_env\n+PYTHON_VERSION=3.10\n+\n+echo \"Creating conda environment $ENV_NAME...\"\n+$CONDA_PATH create -n $ENV_NAME python=$PYTHON_VERSION -y\n+\n+echo \"Environment created successfully\"\ndiff --git a/scripts/setup_environment.sh b/scripts/setup_environment.sh\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000..0000aa9\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/scripts/setup_environment.sh\n@@ -0,0 +1,18 @@\n+#!/bin/bash\n+set -e\n+\n+CONDA_PATH=/opt/conda/bin/conda\n+PIP_PATH=/opt/conda/envs/felafax_env/bin/pip\n+ENV_NAME=felafax_env\n+REPO_DIR=\"/mnt/disk2/felafax_repo\"\n+\n+# Activate conda environment\n+source /opt/conda/bin/activate $ENV_NAME\n+\n+echo \"Installing requirements...\"\n+cd \"$REPO_DIR\"\n+\n+# Install package in editable mode with dependencies\n+$PIP_PATH install -e .\n+\n+echo \"Environment setup complete\""
